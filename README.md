# RBYRCT-Houdini

**Ray-by-Ray CT Simulation Toolkit** using Houdini

This repository contains simulations and tools for modeling the Ray-by-Ray Computed Tomography (RBYRCT) system — a next-gen imaging approach using electronically steered X-ray beams via Janus sphere reflectors.

## 🌟 Features
- Houdini simulation of X-ray beam deflection through 11-layer Janus grids
- Bragg reflection modeling at 4° increments
- Export of simulated scan data for ML analysis or real-world prototyping
- Future support for Unity/Blender visualization pipelines

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Houdini (VEX, VOPs, Mantra/Karma)
- Python (Houdini script automation & export)
- Optional: Unity / Blender for visualization

## 📂 Directory Structure
See `/houdini` for project files, `/scripts` for automation, and `/docs` for tech explainers.

## 🧪 Status
Early dev / simulation prototyping.
